Use processing to generate ready-to-laser-cut objects using physical data (voice spectrum,...)

Note: while this project uses processing as a graphics library, this is a java (and not a pde) project. This allow developers to code processing sketches in their favorite IDE, wich is likely to be a lot better than the processing one.
